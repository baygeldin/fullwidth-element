# fullwidth-element
A Polymer fullwidth text-decorator. It replaces all text within the markup to the fullwidth equivalent. Motivation: according to [Unicode specification](http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/) the sequence of fullwidth characters doesn't considered a word and the line can break in between of it. This component fixes it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ｅｎｊｏｙ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ｙｏｕｒ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ｓｔｙｌｉｓｈ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ｔｅｘｔ！&nbsp;：）
